# Custom Search using plain JavaScript (Web-Components), HTML5 and CSS.

User can search with ID, name, address or pincode.

When user navigates with mouse, keyboard navigation will be overridden and vice-versa.

Keyboard navigation includes tab key and arrow keys.

Matched details will be highlighted in the search results.

`No User Found` template will be displayed when no user matches the search query.

#Note: Plain JS with Web-Components approach is preferred in this implementation to help the integration with any framework easier and modularize the component based on the level of details necessary.

This can be tested with simple http server or with live server plugin in VS code. Cheers :)
